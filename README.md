# Regex Tutorial Project

This project is a beginner's guide to regular expressions (regex). It explains a specific regex pattern and breaks down each component of the expression to describe what it does. The tutorial is designed for web development students and anyone looking to understand regex better.

## Tutorial Description

In this tutorial, we focus on the regex pattern for matching a URL: `^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$`. We dissect this complex expression step by step, explaining the role of each part and how they come together to match URLs.
